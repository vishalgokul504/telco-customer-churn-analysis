## Overview               

This project delivers an end-to-end Customer Churn Analytics solution using SQL, Python, Machine Learning, and Power BI.

The objective is to identify key drivers of customer churn, quantify revenue risk, predict customer attrition, and provide actionable business recommendations for customer retention.

The project combines:

* SQL-based business analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Machine Learning Prediction
* Interactive Power BI Executive Dashboard

This project aims to answer:

* Which customers are most likely to churn?
* What factors contribute most to churn?
* How much revenue is at risk?
* Which customer segments should be prioritized for retention?
* What actions can reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value?

## SQL Analytics

Key business questions answered:

### Contract Type Analysis

Month-to-Month customers exhibited significantly higher churn rates than annual contract customers.

### Revenue Risk Analysis

Revenue exposure was quantified by customer segment and churn category.

### Service Impact Analysis

Customer retention was strongly associated with:

* Online Security
* Tech Support
* Contract Length

### Customer Risk Segmentation

Customers were classified into:

* High Risk
* Medium Risk
* Low Risk

using churn score thresholds.
